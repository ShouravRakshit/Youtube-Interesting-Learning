    "1. Lets say person A worked on the project named X. He installed bunch of packages (sql, mongodb) and many more in a windows machine. Now, person B starts working on the same project but he has a linux machine and he has to install all the dependencies. But there is a good chance there is going to be a mismatch because of different operating system. So, you have to manually fix that issue. Docker solves that issue by containerzing the whole application in a image. As a result, the person B now  just runs the container  and boom the application will work just like person A's machine. "
